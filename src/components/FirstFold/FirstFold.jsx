              I'm Ankan - a fashion buyer, culture connoisseur, food fanatic, and
              a lifelong learner. There has always been a{" "}
              <strong>common thread</strong> of inquisitiveness which has led me
              on a mission to optimize people and processes, and I believe
              anything inquisitive makes the journey exciting. Being a person of
              varied interests, I have two facets that you can have a peek at, now
              that youâ€™re here!
